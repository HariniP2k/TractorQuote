# TractorQuote
Tractor loan applications rely on dealer quotations that are unstructured, handwritten, multilingual, and lack standard formats. Manual data entry is slow and error-prone. This project uses GenAI to extract and validate key fields like Tractor Model, Horsepower (HP), and Quotation Amount, enabling faster and accurate underwriting.
