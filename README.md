# TractorQuote
Tractor loan applications rely on dealer quotations that are unstructured, handwritten, multilingual, and lack standard formats. Manual data entry is slow and error-prone. This project uses GenAI to extract and validate key fields like Tractor Model, Horsepower (HP), and Quotation Amount, enabling faster and accurate underwriting.

🚜 GenAI-Based Tractor Loan Quotation Extraction & Validation

Tractor loan applications rely on dealer quotations that are often unstructured, inconsistent, handwritten, and multilingual, with no standard format. This makes manual data entry and verification by field officers slow, error-prone, and resource-intensive.

This project aims to build a GenAI-driven solution that automatically interprets dealer quotations and extracts key mandatory fields required for underwriting:

Tractor Model Name

Horsepower (HP)

Quotation Amount

By leveraging OCR, NLP, and Generative AI, the system converts unstructured quotation documents into clean, structured, and validated data, significantly improving processing speed, accuracy, and operational efficiency in tractor loan underwriting workflows.
